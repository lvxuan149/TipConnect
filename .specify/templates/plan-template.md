# Implementation Plan: [FEATURE]

**Branch**: `[###-feature-name]` | **Date**: [DATE] | **Spec**: [link]
**Input**: Feature specification from `/specs/[###-feature-name]/spec.md`

**Note**: This template is filled in by the `/speckit.plan` command. See `.specify/scripts/bash/setup-plan.sh` for the execution workflow.

## Summary

[Extract from feature spec: primary requirement + technical approach from research]

## Technical Context

**Language/Version**: Node.js 18.18-20.x, Next.js 14 App Router, TypeScript 5.9  
**Primary Dependencies**: React 18, Drizzle ORM, Neon Postgres, TailwindCSS, SWR, Zod  
**Storage**: Postgres (Neon serverless) via Drizzle migrations  
**Testing**: Vitest (`pnpm test:contract`, `pnpm test:idempotency`, `pnpm test:e2e`)  
**Target Platform**: Web (Solana-facing dashboards and APIs)  
**Project Type**: Single Next.js repo (`app/`, `components/`, `lib/`, `drizzle/`, `tests/`)  
**Performance Goals**: `/api/overview` p95 < 300 ms, `/api/discover` p95 < 500 ms, `/api/creators/*` p95 < 400 ms  
**Constraints**: Must preserve `pnpm dev:up` flow (diagnose -> migrate -> seed -> dev) and contract alignment  
**Scale/Scope**: Supports multi-creator analytics; confirm story/user counts per feature

## Constitution Check

*GATE: Must pass before Phase 0 research. Re-check after Phase 1 design.*

- [ ] **Contract-First Delivery**: Plan documents required updates to `/docs/Contract.md`, `/docs/API.md`, migrations, and `scripts/seed.ts`.
- [ ] **Single-Command Environment Health**: Impact on `pnpm dev:up` and `scripts/diagnose.ts` is addressed, with automation for any new setup steps.
- [ ] **Deterministic Data Baselines**: QA baselines and fixtures (`docs/QA*.md`, `/tests`) are updated or confirmed unchanged.
- [ ] **Test-Gated Releases**: Independent failing tests are outlined per user story prior to implementation.
- [ ] **Blink-First Observability & Performance**: Monitoring/latency changes stay within SLOs and include instrumentation when needed.

> **Fill ONLY if Constitution Check has violations that must be justified**

| Violation | Why Needed | Simpler Alternative Rejected Because |
|-----------|------------|-------------------------------------|
| [e.g., 4th project] | [current need] | [why 3 projects insufficient] |
| [e.g., Repository pattern] | [specific problem] | [why direct DB access insufficient] |
